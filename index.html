        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>We first opened our home to our first kitten named "Kitty". We never had as cat companion in the past and were
            curious to see how he would settle in. We quickly grew love for Kitty and decided to keep him. Years later we 
            dedicated time to feeding stray cats where ever we found them. Most of the cats we have now were once stray.</p>
        <p>Up to this year, we have been able to foster and find homes for many kittens. 
            Some have gone with families that love them, others whom are independent visit us from time to time. </p>
